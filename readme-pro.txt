* MySQL 5.5.5 or greater, OR MariaDB version 10.1 or greater, is required
* WordPress 6.7 or greater

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the WooCommerce plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with the pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting "Save." That should return things to normal.
